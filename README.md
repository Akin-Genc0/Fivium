# Company Website Redesign

A modern redesign of the company's website to improve user experience, visual appeal, and functionality.

## Overview

This is a completely new look at the company's website. The objective of this project is to make it more usable, more beautiful, and perform a lot better. Presently, I'm working on reworking the 
layout and adding responsive design so that it works well on any device. Still a work in progress, but it's turning out to be a much better iteration of the original site.
